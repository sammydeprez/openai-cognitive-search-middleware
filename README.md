# Azure Cognitive Search Middleware

This middleware extends the default endpoint of Azure Cognitive Search, which includes a feature to extract answers based on semantic reranking BM25. With the addition of this middleware, the response to the user remains the same, but the answer is generated by an Azure Open AI Model.

By utilizing this middleware function, there is no need to modify any code in your application if you are already using the semantic answering function.

## Configuration
All necessary parameters can be configured as environment variables in the Azure Function Configuration.

The following table outlines the variables, their corresponding data types, and descriptions:

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SEARCHSERVICE_NAME** | String | The name of your Azure Cognitive Search resource |
| **SEARCHSERVICE_SCORE_THRESHOLD** | Decimal | The middleware filters content based on the Semantic Reranking Score to remove irrelevant context sent to OpenAI. The middleware will use only the results with a higher score than the highest score multiplied by this parameter. |
| **SEARCHSERVICE_MAX_NO_RESULTS** | Integer | The maximum number of results that will be sent to OpenAI Completion API |
| **SEARCHSERVICE_FIELD_CONTENT** | String | The field in your index containing the content to be sent to OpenAI as context |
| **SEARCHSERVICE_FIELD_KEY** | String | The field in your index that contains a unique key to your content. This allows sources to be cited in the answer depending on your system message. |
| **OPENAI_API_KEY** | String | The API Key to your OpenAI service |
| **OPENAI_API_BASE** | String | The API endpoint to your OpenAI service |
| **OPENAI_API_VERSION** | String | The API version to be used for the OpenAI service |
| **OPENAI_API_TYPE** | String | "azure" for Azure OpenAI or "openai" for non-Azure OpenAI endpoints |
| **OPENAI_API_DEFAULT_MODEL** | String | The default OpenAI model to be used, supporting gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4 |
| **OPENAI_API_SYSTEM_MESSAGE** | String | The system message |
